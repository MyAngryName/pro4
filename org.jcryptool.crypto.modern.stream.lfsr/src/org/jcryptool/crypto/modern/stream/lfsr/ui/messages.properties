LfsrWizard_0=LFSR Stream Cipher for
LfsrWizardPage_0=LFSR (linear feedback shift register)
LfsrWizardPage_1=With the LFSR stream cipher, pseudo-random numbers can be generated. A message (from editor or file) can be encrypted by\nXOR-ing with this pseudo-random number sequence. To do this, select the length of the LFSR, the tap settings and the start value.
LfsrWizardPage_10=Display keystream only with the following number of bytes:
LfsrWizardPage_11=You can only enter numbers
LfsrWizardPage_12=The maximum keystream length is {0} bytes.
LfsrWizardPage_13=The entered keystream length must be greater than 0.
LfsrWizardPage_2=Length of LFSR
LfsrWizardPage_3=Select the length of the LFSR:
LfsrWizardPage_4=Reducing the length of the LFSR clears the tap settings and values of any bits after the new LFSR length.
LfsrWizardPage_5=Tap settings
LfsrWizardPage_6=Start value of the register
LfsrWizardPage_7=Output options
LfsrWizardPage_8=Display output only
LfsrWizardPage_9=Display output file and keystream in separate editors. (The keystream and the input stream have the same length.)
LfsrWizardPage_LFSRLengthNote=Note: Maximum 25 registers can be displayed.
LfsrWizardPage_reset=Reset dialog
LfsrWizardPage_resetTooltip=Reset the plugin to its inital state.
LfsrWizardPage_seedValueAs01String=Seed values as 0-1 string:
