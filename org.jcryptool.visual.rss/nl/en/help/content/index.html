<h1>Redactable Signature Schemes</h1>

<p>
	Digital signature schemes are used to provide data integrity and data origin authentication for a signed message. A redactable signature scheme enables the attestation of a message in such a way that, if certain parts of the signed message (known as fields) are redacted (erased, blanked out or permanently removed), the attestation of the redacted message with respect to its integrity and origin authentication can still be verified. 
</p>
<p>
	More precisely, upon signing a message, the signer knowing the private signature key can define which parts of the message can later be redacted (in the sense of ISO/IEC 27038) by any entity only knowing the message, the signature, and the signer’s redaction key. Any other modification of the signed message (e.g. redaction of other message parts or insertion/ modification of any parts) invalidates the attestation given by the signature.  
</p>
<p>
	Redactable signature schemes can serve as a basic building block in many privacy-preserving applications, such as privacy-preserving data sharing or authentication, where an entity can decide to only reveal the information from a larger set of signed information that is absolutely necessary to forward to a receiver, while the latter is still assured that the received information was previously attested, e.g. signed by a public authority.

<h2 id="BPA">Baric Pfitzman Accumulator (BPA)</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, an accumulator scheme allows to represent a finite set X as a single succinct value, called the accumulator. One party having a secret can compute for each x element of X a so called witness, which certifies membership of x in X. Another party only given the accumulator value, the element x and the witness corresponding to the element can verify the membership proof. Without the secret it is not possible to generate verifying witness values. Without the witness it is not possible to verify if x was element of X for which one knows an accumulator.</p>
<p>The implementation in JCrypTool implements the accumulator scheme originally proposed by Barić and Pfitzmann that has been slightly adjusted and published as "Indistinguishability of One-Way Accumulators" by De Meer, Liedl, Pöhls, Posegga and Samelin (available as MIP-1210 at https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/forschung/technische-berichte/mip-1210/).</p>
<p>The original work by Baric and Pfitzmann was published as "Collision-Free Accumulators and Fail-Stop Signature Schemes Without Trees" {available in Proc. of Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT ’97, volume 1233 of LNCS, pages 480–494. Springer, 1997).</p>

<h2 id="GLRSS">Accumulator-based RSS for linear documents (GLRSS)</h2>
	<p>The RSS for linear documents (GLRSS) is based on a cryptographic accumulator scheme with certain cryptographic properties (e.g. BPA) and a digital signature scheme (e.g. RSA).<p>
	<p>In a nutshell, an accumulator scheme allows to represent a finite set X as a single succinct value, called the accumulator. One party having a secret can compute for each x element of X a so called witness, which certifies membership of x in X. Another party only given the accumulator value, the element x and the witness corresponding to the element can verify the membership proof. Without the secret it is not possible to generate verifying witness values. Without the witness it is not possible to verify if x was element of X for which one knows an accumulator.</p>
	<p>Based on the above the GSRSS is build as follows: It computes an accumulator value and all the witnesses representing the set to be signed and then it signs the accumulator value using any digital signature scheme. For verification, the verifier is simply provided the witnesses for each element in the set and it is verified whether the digital signature on the accumulator as well as the witnesses are valid. Redaction amounts to simply throwing away witnesses corresponding to redacted elements.</p>
	<p>In order to encode the order of the message parts the scheme takes special care, not just to take indices. Just taking indices would not result in undetectability of redactions, but would sometimes reveal their positions, e.g. redacting a signed list {1:A,2:B,3:C,4:D,5:E} into {1:A,4:D} would reveal that 2 elements between A and D were removed. This offers the cryptographic property of undetectability of redactions (in the original work termed "transparency" which is unfortunately ambiguous). Undetectability of redaction means that an adversary can not distinguished a signed original message from a redacted signed message.</p>

	<p>This redactable signature scheme allows to <b>protect the integrity and data origin for the contents and as well as the order of the message parts</b>, additionally it allows the signer to <b>define which parts of the message are immutable</b>, i.e. fixed. Upon signature generation the signer defines the order of message parts and for each message part if it can be publicly redacted.</p>
	<p><b>Public redaction</b> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.</p>
	<p>Of course this scheme is <b>unforgeable</b>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised –and thus public—redaction.</p>
	<p>Finally, the <b>redaction is private</b>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=“C” that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=”A” or an original message m’=m1’,m2 with m1’=”B”.</p>
	<p>Further, it remains <b>undetectable if a redaction has previously taken place.</b></p>
	
	<p>GSRSS + GLRSS have been published by David Derler, Henrich C. Pöhls, Kai Samelin, and Daniel Slamanig as "A general framework for redactable signatures and new constructions" available in Soonhak Kwon and Aaram Yun, editors, Information Security and Cryptology - ICISC 2015, pages 3–19, Springer, 2016.</p>

Redaction amounts to simply throwing away witnesses corresponding to redacted elements.  The scheme published does not offer to control what element of the set is redactable and which is not, always all elements are redactable. This offers the cryptographic property of undetectability of redactions (in the original work termed "transparency" which is unfortunately ambiguous). Undetectability of redaction means that an adversary can not distinguished a signed original message from a redacted signed message, e.g. directly signed {A,D} looks indistinguishable from {A,D} obtained by redaction of a signed {A,B,C,D,E}.</p>
	
	<p>This redactable signature scheme allows to<strong>&nbsp;protect the contents of message part, but not their order</strong>. Think of the message parts being a set in the mathematical sense.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Additionally it allows the signer to <strong>define which parts of the message are immutable</strong>, i.e. fixed. Upon signature generation the signer defines mutually distinct message parts and for each message part if it can be publicly redacted.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Public redaction</strong> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Of course this scheme is <strong>unforgeable</strong>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised &ndash;and thus public&mdash;redaction.</p>
	<p>Finally, the <strong>redaction is</strong> <strong>private</strong>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=&ldquo;C&rdquo; that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=&rdquo;A&rdquo; or an original message m&rsquo;=m1&rsquo;,m2 with m1&rsquo;=&rdquo;B&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Further, it remains <strong>undetectable if a redaction has previously taken place.</strong></p>
