<h1>Redactable Signature Schemes</h1>

<p>
	Digital signature schemes are used to provide data integrity and data origin authentication for a signed message. A redactable signature scheme enables the attestation of a message in such a way that, if certain parts of the signed message (known as fields) are redacted (erased, blanked out or permanently removed), the attestation of the redacted message with respect to its integrity and origin authentication can still be verified. 
</p>
<p>
	More precisely, upon signing a message, the signer knowing the private signature key can define which parts of the message can later be redacted (in the sense of ISO/IEC 27038) by any entity only knowing the message, the signature, and the signer’s redaction key. Any other modification of the signed message (e.g. redaction of other message parts or insertion/ modification of any parts) invalidates the attestation given by the signature.  
</p>
<p>
	Redactable signature schemes can serve as a basic building block in many privacy-preserving applications, such as privacy-preserving data sharing or authentication, where an entity can decide to only reveal the information from a larger set of signed information that is absolutely necessary to forward to a receiver, while the latter is still assured that the received information was previously attested, e.g. signed by a public authority.

	<p>This redactable signature scheme allows to <b>protect the integrity and data origin for the contents and as well as the order of the message parts</b>, additionally it allows the signer to <b>define which parts of the message are immutable</b>, i.e. fixed. Upon signature generation the signer defines the order of message parts and for each message part if it can be publicly redacted.</p>
	<p><b>Public redaction</b> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.</p>
	<p>Of course this scheme is <b>unforgeable</b>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised –and thus public—redaction.</p>
	<p>Finally, the <b>redaction is private</b>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=“C” that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=”A” or an original message m’=m1’,m2 with m1’=”B”.</p>
	<p>Further, it remains <b>undetectable if a redaction has previously taken place.</b></p>

	<p>This redactable signature scheme allows to<strong>&nbsp;protect the contents of message part, but not their order</strong>. Think of the message parts being a set in the mathematical sense.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Additionally it allows the signer to <strong>define which parts of the message are immutable</strong>, i.e. fixed. Upon signature generation the signer defines mutually distinct message parts and for each message part if it can be publicly redacted.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Public redaction</strong> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Of course this scheme is <strong>unforgeable</strong>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised &ndash;and thus public&mdash;redaction.</p>
	<p>Finally, the <strong>redaction is</strong> <strong>private</strong>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=&ldquo;C&rdquo; that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=&rdquo;A&rdquo; or an original message m&rsquo;=m1&rsquo;,m2 with m1&rsquo;=&rdquo;B&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Further, it remains <strong>undetectable if a redaction has previously taken place.</strong></p>
	
<h2 id="GenericConstruction">Generic Construction</h2>
    <p>This redactable signature scheme allows to<strong>&nbsp;protect the contents of message part, as well as their order</strong>. After signature generation all message parts can be publicly redacted.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Public redaction</strong> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.</p>
    <p>Of course this scheme is <strong>unforgeable</strong>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised &ndash;and thus public&mdash;redaction.</p>
    <p>Finally, the <strong>redaction is</strong> <strong>private</strong>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=&ldquo;C&rdquo; that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=&rdquo;A&rdquo; or an original message m&rsquo;=m1&rsquo;,m2 with m1&rsquo;=&rdquo;B&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, any previous redaction remains <strong>detectable</strong>, e.g. leaves a trace.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
