<h1>Redactable Signature Schemes</h1>

<p>
	Digital signature schemes are used to provide data integrity and data origin authentication for a signed message. A redactable signature scheme enables the attestation of a message in such a way that, if certain parts of the signed message (known as fields) are redacted (erased, blanked out or permanently removed), the attestation of the redacted message with respect to its integrity and origin authentication can still be verified. 
</p>
<p>
	More precisely, upon signing a message, the signer knowing the private signature key can define which parts of the message can later be redacted (in the sense of ISO/IEC 27038) by any entity only knowing the message, the signature, and the signer’s redaction key. Any other modification of the signed message (e.g. redaction of other message parts or insertion/ modification of any parts) invalidates the attestation given by the signature.  
</p>
<p>
	Redactable signature schemes can serve as a basic building block in many privacy-preserving applications, such as privacy-preserving data sharing or authentication, where an entity can decide to only reveal the information from a larger set of signed information that is absolutely necessary to forward to a receiver, while the latter is still assured that the received information was previously attested, e.g. signed by a public authority.

<h2 id="BPA">Baric Pfitzman Accumulator (BPA)</h2>
<p>In a nutshell, an accumulator scheme allows to represent a finite set X as a single succinct value, called the accumulator. One party having a secret can compute for each x element of X a so called witness, which certifies membership of x in X. Another party only given the accumulator value, the element x and the witness corresponding to the element can verify the membership proof. Without the secret it is not possible to generate verifying witness values. Without the witness it is not possible to verify if x was element of X for which one knows an accumulator.</p>
<p>The implementation in JCrypTool implements the accumulator scheme originally proposed by Barić and Pfitzmann that has been slightly adjusted and published as "Indistinguishability of One-Way Accumulators" by De Meer, Liedl, Pöhls, Posegga and Samelin (available as MIP-1210 at https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/forschung/technische-berichte/mip-1210/).</p>
<p>The original work by Baric and Pfitzmann was published as "Collision-Free Accumulators and Fail-Stop Signature Schemes Without Trees" {available in Proc. of Advances in Cryptology – EUROCRYPT ’97, volume 1233 of LNCS, pages 480–494. Springer, 1997).</p>

<h2 id="GLRSS">Accumulator-based RSS for linear documents (GLRSS)</h2>
	<p>The RSS for linear documents (GLRSS) is based on a cryptographic accumulator scheme with certain cryptographic properties (e.g. BPA) and a digital signature scheme (e.g. RSA).<p>
	<p>In a nutshell, an accumulator scheme allows to represent a finite set X as a single succinct value, called the accumulator. One party having a secret can compute for each x element of X a so called witness, which certifies membership of x in X. Another party only given the accumulator value, the element x and the witness corresponding to the element can verify the membership proof. Without the secret it is not possible to generate verifying witness values. Without the witness it is not possible to verify if x was element of X for which one knows an accumulator.</p>
	<p>Based on the above the GSRSS is build as follows: It computes an accumulator value and all the witnesses representing the set to be signed and then it signs the accumulator value using any digital signature scheme. For verification, the verifier is simply provided the witnesses for each element in the set and it is verified whether the digital signature on the accumulator as well as the witnesses are valid. Redaction amounts to simply throwing away witnesses corresponding to redacted elements.</p>
	<p>In order to encode the order of the message parts the scheme takes special care, not just to take indices. Just taking indices would not result in undetectability of redactions, but would sometimes reveal their positions, e.g. redacting a signed list {1:A,2:B,3:C,4:D,5:E} into {1:A,4:D} would reveal that 2 elements between A and D were removed. This offers the cryptographic property of undetectability of redactions (in the original work termed "transparency" which is unfortunately ambiguous). Undetectability of redaction means that an adversary can not distinguished a signed original message from a redacted signed message.</p>

	<p>This redactable signature scheme allows to <b>protect the integrity and data origin for the contents and as well as the order of the message parts</b>, additionally it allows the signer to <b>define which parts of the message are immutable</b>, i.e. fixed. Upon signature generation the signer defines the order of message parts and for each message part if it can be publicly redacted.</p>
	<p><b>Public redaction</b> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.</p>
	<p>Of course this scheme is <b>unforgeable</b>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised –and thus public—redaction.</p>
	<p>Finally, the <b>redaction is private</b>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=“C” that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=”A” or an original message m’=m1’,m2 with m1’=”B”.</p>
	<p>Further, it remains <b>undetectable if a redaction has previously taken place.</b></p>

<h2 id="GSRSS">Accumulator-based RSS for sets (GSRSS)</h2>

Redaction amounts to simply throwing away witnesses corresponding to redacted elements.  The scheme published does not offer to control what element of the set is redactable and which is not, always all elements are redactable. This offers the cryptographic property of undetectability of redactions (in the original work termed "transparency" which is unfortunately ambiguous). Undetectability of redaction means that an adversary can not distinguished a signed original message from a redacted signed message, e.g. directly signed {A,D} looks indistinguishable from {A,D} obtained by redaction of a signed {A,B,C,D,E}.</p>
	
	<p>This redactable signature scheme allows to<strong>&nbsp;protect the contents of message part, but not their order</strong>. Think of the message parts being a set in the mathematical sense.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Additionally it allows the signer to <strong>define which parts of the message are immutable</strong>, i.e. fixed. Upon signature generation the signer defines mutually distinct message parts and for each message part if it can be publicly redacted.&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>Public redaction</strong> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="GenericConstruction">Generic Construction based on Hash-Trees (GC)</h2>
	<p>The generic construction (GC) is based on a Merkle hash tree (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree</a>). The hash tree is a tree in which every leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every non-leaf node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes.</p>
	<p>Each leaf node is generated by hashing the contents of the message part together with two random values (one wich is the same for all message parts; and one which is randomly chosen for each message part individually), in other words, the contents of the message parts and a random are the data blocks over which the has tree is build.</p>
	<p>A cryptographically secure hash function (e.g. SHA-3) has to be used and the root hash will depend on every message part. The root hash is finally signed using a digital signature scheme (e.g. RSA).</p>
	<p>In a nutshell, removing a message parts would mean to remove their contents from the message and their random value and substitute it by providing just the hash. The scheme published does not offer to control what element of the set is redactable and which is not, always all elements are redactable</p>
	<p>The scheme further requires to provide information, i.e. the hash, for each of the redacted message parts, thus it offers the cryptographic property of detectability of redactions. Detectability of redaction means that any third party can distinguish a signed original message from a redacted signed message, e.g. directly signed {A,D} looks distinguishable from {A,-,-,D,-} obtained by redaction of a signed {A,B,C,D,E} assuming "-" is used as a special sign to indicate a redacted message part.</p>
	<p>Moreover, the scheme would allow to merge two different redacted versions generated from the same parent document (identified by the same message-wide random), e.g.  {A,-,-} and {-,B,-} when both obtained by redaction of a signed {A,B,C} can be merged into {A,B,-}, but the contents of the last message part C remain private, e.g. one can not get any information about those contents.</p>
	
    <p>This redactable signature scheme allows to<strong>&nbsp;protect the contents of message part, as well as their order</strong>. After signature generation all message parts can be publicly redacted.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Public redaction</strong> means that if authorised by the signer the respective redactable message part could be removed from the set without the need for additional keys, e.g. public domain parameters are enough to successfully redact the message part.</p>
    <p>Of course this scheme is <strong>unforgeable</strong>, e.g. the adversary not in possession of the secret signature key cannot produce a signature that verifies on a message except for those messages that can be generated by carrying out one or more authorised &ndash;and thus public&mdash;redaction.</p>
    <p>Finally, the <strong>redaction is</strong> <strong>private</strong>, thus the redacted message reveals no information about the content of the message part that was redacted, i.e. the adversary cannot distinguish on seeing a redacted message containing just m2=&ldquo;C&rdquo; that was generated by redacting m1 from either an original message m=m1,m2 with m1=&rdquo;A&rdquo; or an original message m&rsquo;=m1&rsquo;,m2 with m1&rsquo;=&rdquo;B&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, any previous redaction remains <strong>detectable</strong>, e.g. leaves a trace.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    
    <p>GC + SBZ01-MERSAProd have been published by R. Steinfeld, L. Bull, and Y. Zheng as "Content extraction signatures" in ICISC in 2001.</p>
    
<h2 id="SBZ02-MersaProd">Construction based on multi-exponent RSA algorithm (SBZ01-MERSAProd)</h2>
	<p>The SBZ01-MERSAProd algorithm has its name from the original work. It is based on the RSA algorithm.</p>
	<p>Each message part requires one pair of public/private exponents, generated based on the multi-exponent RSA algorithm (see original work <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_17">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_17</a> or a short write-up <a href="https://cryptome.org/jya/fiat-rsa.htm">https://cryptome.org/jya/fiat-rsa.htm</a>). In a nutshell it allows you to generate one RSA signature value (also called the batch signature) from many RSA signatures as long as those signatures are generated from parameters using the same modulus (N). As such during key creation you have to generate a key-pair that contains as many exponents for the same modulus as you want to sign message part. As it is RSA one could generate missing exponent pairs also later if you still know the factorisation of the modulus, but you could not have the ability to pre-share or certify those public exponents in public key.</p>
	<p>Each message part is signed using one exponent from the public key, and the signature for the message is the accumulated signature of all message parts' signatures. Removing a message part would mean to remove that part's signature from the overall signature. Therefore the redaction requires to first extract all the individual signatures from the batch signature using the information from the original message parts. Then remove the message part and re-calculate the batch signature without the removed part's individual signature. Again a random value per message is added to avoid mixing message parts from individual messages, and substitute it by providing just the hash.</p>
	<p>The scheme published does offer to control what element of the set is redactable and which is not, by listing those that are non-redactable in a signed policy. </p>
	<p>The scheme further requires to provide information, i.e. the hash, for each of the redacted message parts, thus it offers the cryptographic property of detectability of redactions. Detectability of redaction means that any third party can distinguish a signed original message from a redacted signed message, e.g. directly signed {A,D} looks distinguishable from {A,-,-,D,-} obtained by redaction of a signed {A,B,C,D,E} assuming "-" is used as a special sign to indicate a redacted message part.</p>
